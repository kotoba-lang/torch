  "ADR-2607131500 Phase 1 — the first real `torch.ports/IBackend`: wires
  torch-clj's described layer graph to num-clj's verified tensor ops
  (`num.core`/`num.tensor`), so `torch.core/run` actually computes instead of
  throwing \"torch-clj is shape-only here\".

  SCOPE (deliberately not full PyTorch-layer coverage): `:linear`, `:relu`,
  `:silu`, `:sigmoid`, `:tanh`, `:gelu`, `:softmax`, `:rmsnorm`, affine `:layernorm`/`:groupnorm`, and full NCHW `:conv2d` execute
  through verified num ops. Convolution supports batches, groups/depthwise,
  bias, stride, padding, and dilation. Learned `:multihead-attention` supports
  batch-first inputs plus causal, key-padding, and separate context sequences
  through runtime layer options. Parameter-free `:attention` remains the original
  rank-2 form. `num-heads` selects multi-head via
  `num.tensor/multi-head-attention`, which is EXACTLY `num.tensor/attention`
  at num-heads=1 (verified in num's own test suite). Every other layer type
  throws.

  WEIGHTS: torch-clj's model EDN is shape-and-parameter-COUNT only — it
  never carries actual weight values (by design, see torch.model). This
  backend therefore takes weights as an explicit, caller-supplied vector
  (one entry per layer of the NORMALIZED model, `nil` for parameterless
  layers), not something it invents or loads. `random-weights` below is a
  small, deterministic (not cryptographic, not torch/numpy-matching)
  generator for exercising a model end-to-end without hand-writing every
  number. Real checkpoint weights are loaded through `torch.safetensors` and
  `torch.state-dict`.

  BACKEND CHOICE: this wraps whatever `num.protocol/IBackend` the caller
  passes to `num-backend`. CPU is the reference oracle; the device-native
  learned-attention path is verified through Deno WebGPU on Apple Metal."
